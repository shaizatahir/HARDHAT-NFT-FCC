We go through creating 3 different kinds of NFTs.
3 contracts

1. A Basic NFT
2. Random Ipfs Nft
   That uses Randomness to generate a unique NFT

- IPFS Hosted NFT
- Pros: Cheap
- Cons: Someone needs to pin our data

3. Dynamic SVG Nft
   SVG NFT (Hosted 100% on-chain)
   Uses price feeds to be dynamic

- Pros: The data is on Chain!
- Cons: much more expensive

If price of ETH is above X -> Happy Face
If it's below X -> Sad Face
